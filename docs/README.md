# CIDNamer

## Purpose

This is a plugin for [XIVLauncher/Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).  The only thing that it does is maintain a list of content ID <-> character name + server mappings (and only for your own characters).  This is intended for use with my offline utilities to make things more automatic.

## Usage
This plugin works automatically.  You can change the output folder in the plugin settings if you want to use this for some other purpose.

## Installation
This is not a main repo plugin.  Can be installed from [my third party plugin repo](https://github.com/PunishedPineapple/DalamudPluginRepo).

## Precautions
Don't share the generated list with anyone else.  Content IDs aren't ultra sensitive per se, but it's probably about the same risk level to your account as giving someone random your license plate number, home address, or phone number would be to you IRL.

## License
Code and executable are covered under the [MIT License](../LICENSE).  Final Fantasy XIV (and any associated data used by this plugin) is owned by and copyright Square Enix.
